            <h1>Storage</h1>
            <p>Storage in computing refers to the components and methods used to retain digital data. Unlike memory, which is primarily for temporary data access, storage is designed for long-term preservation of information, even when the computer is powered off.</p>
            <p>There are various types of storage devices, each with different characteristics regarding speed, capacity, and cost. Common types include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Hard Disk Drives (HDDs):</b> Traditional storage devices that use spinning platters and read/write heads to store and retrieve data magnetically. They offer large capacities at a relatively low cost.</li>
                <li><b>Solid State Drives (SSDs):</b> Newer storage devices that use flash memory to store data. They are significantly faster, more durable, and consume less power than HDDs, but typically have a higher cost per gigabyte.</li>
                <li><b>USB Flash Drives:</b> Portable storage devices that use flash memory, commonly used for transferring data between computers.</li>
                <li><b>Optical Discs (CDs, DVDs, Blu-ray):</b> Storage media that use lasers to read and write data. While less common for primary computer storage today, they are still used for media distribution and archival purposes.</li>
                <li><b>Network Attached Storage (NAS):</b> Dedicated file storage that allows multiple users and client devices to retrieve data from centralized disk capacity over a network.</li>
                <li><b>Cloud Storage:</b> Data stored on remote servers accessed over the internet, managed by a third-party provider. This offers scalability, accessibility, and often redundancy.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The choice of storage depends on the specific needs of a system, balancing factors like performance, capacity, reliability, and budget. Modern computers often utilize a combination of storage types, such as an SSD for the operating system and frequently used applications, and an HDD for mass storage of files.</p>
            <p>Understanding storage technologies is crucial for managing data effectively, ensuring data integrity, and optimizing system performance in various computing environments.</p>
