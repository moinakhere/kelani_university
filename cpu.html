            <h1>CPU</h1>
            <p>CPU stands for Central Processing Unit, which is the primary component of a computer that performs most of the processing inside a computer.</p>
            <p>It is often referred to as the brain of the computer, as it carries out instructions from programs by performing basic arithmetic, logic, control, and input/output operations specified by the instructions.</p>
            <p>Modern CPUs are highly complex and can contain billions of transistors, allowing them to perform billions of calculations per second.</p>
            <p>CPUs are typically housed in a single chip and are designed to execute a wide range of tasks, from simple calculations to complex simulations.</p>
            <p>They are essential for running operating systems and applications, making them a critical component of any computing device, including desktops, laptops, and servers.</p>
            <p>In addition to the main CPU, many systems also include additional processors such as graphics processing units (GPUs) that handle specific tasks like rendering images and video, enhancing overall performance.</p>
            <p>Advancements in CPU technology continue to drive improvements in computing power, energy efficiency, and overall system performance, making them a key focus in the development of new computing technologies.</p>
            <p>For more information, you can visit the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit" target="main">Wikipedia page on Central Processing Units</a>.</p>
            <p>Understanding how CPUs work is essential for anyone interested in computer science, software development, or hardware engineering, as it lays the foundation for understanding how computers operate at a fundamental level.</p>
            <p>Whether you are a student, a professional, or simply a tech enthusiast, learning about CPUs can provide valuable insights into the inner workings of modern technology.</p>
