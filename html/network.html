        <h1>Networking</h1><font size="6">
        <p>Computer networking is the practice of connecting computers and other devices together to share data and resources. This allows users to communicate, access shared files, and utilize shared hardware like printers.</p>
        <p>Networks can range from small local area networks (LANs) connecting devices within a single building to vast wide area networks (WANs) like the internet, spanning across the globe.</p>
        <p>Key components of a network include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Routers:</b> Devices that forward data packets between computer networks, creating an overlay internetwork.</li>
            <li><b>Switches:</b> Devices that connect devices in a network and filter and forward data packets to the intended recipient.</li>
            <li><b>Cables:</b> Physical media (like Ethernet cables) used to transmit data between devices.</li>
            <li><b>Wireless Access Points (WAPs):</b> Devices that allow wireless devices to connect to a wired network.</li>
            <li><b>Network Interface Cards (NICs):</b> Hardware components that connect a computer to a computer network.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Networking relies on various protocols, which are sets of rules that govern how data is transmitted and received. Examples include TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol), HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), and FTP (File Transfer Protocol).</p>
        <p>Understanding networking concepts is essential in today's interconnected world, whether you're setting up a home network, managing a corporate infrastructure, or developing web applications.</p>
