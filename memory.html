        <h1>Memory</h1>
        <p>Memory in computing refers to the components of a computer that store data temporarily or permanently, allowing the system to access and process information efficiently.</p>
        <p>There are two main types of memory: volatile and non-volatile. Volatile memory, such as RAM (Random Access Memory), loses its data when the power is turned off, while non-volatile memory, like hard drives and SSDs (Solid State Drives), retains data even without power.</p>
        <p>Memory plays a crucial role in the performance of a computer, as it determines how much data can be stored and accessed quickly. More memory allows for better multitasking and faster application performance.</p>
        <p>Modern computers often use a combination of different types of memory to optimize speed and storage capacity, including cache memory, which is a small amount of high-speed memory located close to the CPU for quick access to frequently used data.</p>
        <p>Understanding how memory works is essential for anyone involved in computer science, software development, or hardware engineering, as it impacts everything from system design to application performance.</p>
